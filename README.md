<h1 align="center">Main Icons</h1>
Main Icons aims to take the over-engineered approach to solve the problem of website social images and glyphs; Minimum viable product (MVP) icon sizes to ensure are ‘just’ scalable enough to look great up to common web usages and social media icons demands. These icons are not the company logos or usable for anything outside of being the icons on the footer or headers of your business, website or blog. What you lose in large resolutions and icon scalability, you gain in tiny file sizes; with an average size of just 0.6kb (600 bytes) this means you can have ten social media icons and it will still compress into less than 1 gzipped network packet.

If you are looking for the smallest possible scaler vector graphics (SVG) social media and website icons, Main Icons has the repository and CDN hosted solution for you.


## Main JS objective
The objective of Main JS is to deliver the best possible experience for website users, developers and website owners.

This functionality is platform agnostic, accessibility aware and has no need for backend software packages, costly infrastructure or connectivity requirements.

### About the developer

Copyright (C) 2025 **Andy Futcher**, I am the developer and maintainer of Main JS and Main HTML project and professional analyst at a not-for-profit health insurer.
Main JS is free and open source and will always be, my goal is to give everyone possible a first class ticket to the most well known and well-written markup language on earth; HTML. This is not just because of the projects chosen licence (GPLv3,) but it's a commitment to remain impartial and community focused and to never sell out or steer Main JS away from the core focus of portability and maintainability.
